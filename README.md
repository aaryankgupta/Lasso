# Lasso_Game

The objective of the game is to score the most points by catching coins.
Catching a coin while it is green results in an extra point and catching it red deducts a point.
The coins switch colors every few seconds. Try to catch them before they turn red, and yank
otherwise.
You get three lives at the beginning of the game and you lose if you have no lives.
You have to catch a coin(green or red) every 10 seconds, otherwise you lose a life.
You can increase your life by one by catching a special golden coin using a special key g.
The golden special coin is hard to catch as it moves randomly and changes its position very fast.
Avoid the black obstacle which moves in the same way as the golden coin to avoid losing a life.

Commands:
t throw lasso.
y yank lasso
l loop lasso
g catch golden coin
q quit game
[ decrease lasso release angle
